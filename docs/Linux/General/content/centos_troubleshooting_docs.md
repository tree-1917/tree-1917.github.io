### **4. Practical Troubleshooting Script for CentOS** 🖥️💻

Automating troubleshooting tasks can save time and ensure consistency. Below is a practical script designed for CentOS systems to collect important information and facilitate communication with developers.

#### **4.1 Script Overview** 📄📝

The script performs the following actions:

1. **System Information Collection:** Gathers details about the system's hardware and software.
2. **Service Status Checks:** Lists the status of critical services.
3. **Resource Usage Reporting:** Reports on CPU, memory, and disk usage.
4. **Log Collection:** Extracts recent log entries related to common issues.
5. **Packaging and Sending Data:** Packages the collected information and prepares it for sending to developers.

#### **4.2 Script Code** 🖥️🔧

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# CentOS Troubleshooting Script
# This script collects system information, service statuses, resource usage, and relevant logs.

# Define output file
OUTPUT_FILE="troubleshooting_report_$(date +%F).tar.gz"

# Create a temporary directory
TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d -t troubleshooting-XXXXXX)

echo "Collecting system information..." 🖥️
# System Information
hostnamectl > "$TMP_DIR/system_info.txt"
uname -a >> "$TMP_DIR/system_info.txt"
cat /etc/centos-release >> "$TMP_DIR/system_info.txt"

echo "Checking service statuses..." 🔍
# Service Statuses
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running > "$TMP_DIR/running_services.txt"

echo "Gathering resource usage..." 📊
# Resource Usage
top -b -n1 | head -n 20 > "$TMP_DIR/top_output.txt"
df -h > "$TMP_DIR/disk_usage.txt"
free -h > "$TMP_DIR/memory_usage.txt"

echo "Collecting recent logs..." 📖
# Recent Logs (last 100 lines)
sudo journalctl -xe | tail -n 100 > "$TMP_DIR/recent_logs.txt"

echo "Identifying top CPU-consuming processes..." 🐢
# Top CPU-consuming processes
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 10 | awk '{print $1, $2, $11}' > "$TMP_DIR/top_cpu_processes.txt"

echo "Identifying top Memory-consuming processes..." 🧠
# Top Memory-consuming processes
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 10 | awk '{print $1, $2, $11}' > "$TMP_DIR/top_mem_processes.txt"

echo "Packaging all collected information..." 📦
# Package all collected information
tar -czvf "$OUTPUT_FILE" -C "$TMP_DIR" .

# Clean up temporary directory
rm -rf "$TMP_DIR"

echo "Troubleshooting report created: $OUTPUT_FILE" 🎉
echo "You can now send this report to the developers for further analysis." 📤
```

#### **4.3 How to Use the Script** 🛠️🚀

1. **Save the Script:**

   - Create a new file named `troubleshoot_centos.sh`.
   - Copy and paste the script code into the file.

2. **Make the Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x troubleshoot_centos.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   ./troubleshoot_centos.sh
   ```

4. **Send the Report:**
   - After execution, a file named `troubleshooting_report_YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz` will be created.
   - Send this file to the developers or support team for analysis.

**Note:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access system logs and execute the script. Running the script with `sudo` may be required for comprehensive log access.
