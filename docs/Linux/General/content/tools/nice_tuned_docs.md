## What Does "Tune System Performance" Mean? üîß

**Tuning system performance** refers to the process of optimizing various system parameters to improve the performance of a computer system. This process involves:

- **Adjusting hardware settings**: Modifying system BIOS settings or hardware configurations.
- **Optimizing software settings**: Tweaking system and application settings for improved performance.
- **Monitoring performance**: Using tools to track and analyze system performance metrics.

Effective tuning helps in achieving a balance between system speed, responsiveness, and resource usage, tailored to specific workloads or applications.

## Optimizing System Performance with **tuned** Daemon ‚öôÔ∏è

**Optimizing system performance** with **tuned** involves using predefined profiles to adjust system settings automatically based on different usage scenarios. This ensures that the system operates efficiently according to the current workload.

### What is **tuned**?

**Tuned** is a Linux daemon designed to dynamically adjust system settings to optimize performance. It applies predefined profiles to the system to optimize various parameters such as CPU frequency, I/O scheduler, and power management.

### Common **tuned** Profiles üõ†Ô∏è

Here is a table listing some common **tuned** profiles:

| **Profile**              | **Description**                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `balanced`               | Balances performance and power consumption.             |
| `high-performance`       | Maximizes performance at the expense of power usage.    |
| `power-saving`           | Reduces power consumption to extend battery life.       |
| `throughput-performance` | Optimizes for high data throughput and performance.     |
| `virtual-guest`          | Optimizes for virtualized environments.                 |
| `network-latency`        | Minimizes network latency for real-time applications.   |
| `virtual-host`           | Optimizes for performance in virtual host environments. |

### Installing and Configuring **tuned**

**Installation:**

To install **tuned**, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tuned
```

**Configuration:**

1. **List Available Profiles:**

   ```bash
   tuned-adm list
   ```

2. **Apply a Profile:**

   ```bash
   sudo tuned-adm profile <profile-name>
   ```

   Replace `<profile-name>` with the profile you wish to apply.

3. **Check Current Profile:**

   ```bash
   tuned-adm active
   ```

4. **View Profile Details:**

   ```bash
   tuned-adm profile <profile-name> --details
   ```

### **tuned** Usage Script

Here‚Äôs a script to automate **tuned** profile management:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# List available profiles
echo "Available tuned profiles:"
tuned-adm list

# Apply a specific profile
PROFILE="balanced"
echo "Applying profile: $PROFILE"
sudo tuned-adm profile $PROFILE

# Display the active profile
echo "Current active profile:"
tuned-adm active

# Display details of the applied profile
echo "Profile details:"
tuned-adm profile $PROFILE --details
```

## Understanding **nice** and **renice** Commands ‚è´

The **nice** and **renice** commands are used to adjust the priority of processes, which can influence their CPU time allocation.

### What are **nice** and **renice**?

- **nice**: Starts a new process with a specified priority.
- **renice**: Changes the priority of an already running process.

The priority range for **nice** is from `-20` (highest priority) to `19` (lowest priority). Processes inherit their nice value from their parent process, which is usually `0` by default.

### Prioritizing Processes with **nice**

- **`-20`**: Highest priority.
- **`19`**: Lowest priority.
- **Default**: `0`.

### Nice Levels vs. PRI

- **Nice Level Priority**: A user-space value, affecting the process's CPU scheduling priority, ranges from `-20` to `19`.
- **PRI (Kernel Priority)**: The actual priority used by the Linux kernel for process scheduling, ranges from `0` (highest) to `139` (lowest) for real-time processes, and `100` to `139` for user processes.

### **nice** Use Case Script

Here‚Äôs a script to manage process priorities using **nice**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Start a high-priority process
echo "Starting a high-priority process..."
nice -n -10 your_command_here &

# Start a low-priority process
echo "Starting a low-priority process..."
nice -n 10 your_command_here &
```
