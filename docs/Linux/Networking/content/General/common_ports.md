# 📘 Commonly Used Port Numbers on Servers

When managing a server, it's crucial to understand the significance of different port numbers. Ports are numerical labels used in networking to route data to the correct application on a server. Each service that runs on a server typically listens on a specific port.

### 🌐 HTTP (Port 80)

- **Protocol:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- **Usage:** HTTP is used for unencrypted web traffic, allowing clients (browsers) to communicate with web servers. It’s the standard port for most websites that don’t use encryption.

### 🔒 HTTPS (Port 443)

- **Protocol:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
- **Usage:** HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, providing encrypted communication between the client and server. It’s widely used to protect sensitive data, like login credentials and payment information.

### ✉️ SMTP (Port 25)

- **Protocol:** Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- **Usage:** SMTP is the standard protocol for sending emails across the Internet. It is used by mail servers to send and relay outgoing emails.

### 📬 IMAP (Port 143)

- **Protocol:** Internet Message Access Protocol
- **Usage:** IMAP is used for retrieving emails from a mail server, allowing users to view and manage their emails without downloading them.

### 📫 IMAPS (Port 993)

- **Protocol:** Internet Message Access Protocol Secure
- **Usage:** IMAPS is the secure version of IMAP, encrypting the retrieval of emails from a mail server.

### 📩 POP3 (Port 110)

- **Protocol:** Post Office Protocol version 3
- **Usage:** POP3 is another protocol for retrieving emails from a mail server, typically downloading the emails to the client.

### 📧 POP3S (Port 995)

- **Protocol:** Post Office Protocol version 3 Secure
- **Usage:** POP3S is the secure version of POP3, encrypting the retrieval of emails from a mail server.

### 💻 SSH (Port 22)

- **Protocol:** Secure Shell
- **Usage:** SSH is used for securely logging into a remote server and executing commands over an encrypted connection. It's essential for remote server management.

### 📡 DNS (Port 53)

- **Protocol:** Domain Name System
- **Usage:** DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites using human-readable names instead of numeric IP addresses.

### 🔄 FTP (Port 21)

- **Protocol:** File Transfer Protocol
- **Usage:** FTP is used for transferring files between a client and server. It allows users to upload, download, and manage files on a server.

### 📶 DHCP (Ports 67 and 68)

- **Protocol:** Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- **Usage:** DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network, ensuring proper communication on the network.

### 📝 Syslog (Port 514)

- **Protocol:** Syslog
- **Usage:** Syslog is used for forwarding log messages in an IP network. It is commonly used for centralized logging, where a server collects logs from various devices (like routers, switches, and servers) across the network.
