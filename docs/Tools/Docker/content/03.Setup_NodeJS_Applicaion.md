### üü¢ What Are the Starter Steps?

Before diving into Node.js development, you'll need to set up a few essential tools on your machine.

#### 1. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

**VS Code** is a lightweight, powerful code editor that's great for writing and debugging Node.js code.

**Steps to Install:**

1. Go to the official VS Code website: [VS Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Follow the installation prompts.

**Bonus:** Install the **Node.js Extension Pack** in VS Code for additional Node.js development features.

#### 2. Install Node.js

**Node.js** is the runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript on the server.

**Steps to Install:**

1. Visit the Node.js official website: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the latest **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version for your platform.
3. Follow the instructions to install Node.js and **npm** (Node Package Manager), which is automatically bundled with Node.js.

**Verify Installation:**

- Open a terminal and run the following commands to confirm that Node.js and npm are installed:

  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

You should see the versions of Node.js and npm printed out.

#### 3. Install Docker

**Docker** helps containerize your application, ensuring it can run consistently in different environments.

**Steps to Install:**

1. Go to the official Docker website: [Docker Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Download **Docker Desktop** for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions provided for your platform.
4. Once installed, start Docker Desktop.

**Verify Installation:**

- Run the following command in your terminal to check if Docker is installed:

  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

You should see the Docker version printed out.

### üöÄ Create a Simple Node.js Application

Now that we have the required tools, let's create a simple Node.js application.

#### 1. Initialize a New Node.js Project

1. Create a new directory for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-node-app
   cd my-node-app
   ```

2. Initialize a Node.js project by running:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

This will create a `package.json` file that stores metadata about your project and its dependencies.

#### 2. Write a Simple Server

Create an `index.js` file in your project directory and add the following code:

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
  res.end("Hello, World!\n");
});

const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}/`);
});
```

#### 3. Run the Application

To start your Node.js application, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see **"Hello, World!"**.

---

### üê≥ Dockerize the Application

Now, let's containerize the Node.js application using Docker.

#### 1. Create a `Dockerfile`

In the root of your project directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` and add the following content:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image as a base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the Node.js application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

#### 2. Build the Docker Image

Run the following command to build your Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
```

This command tells Docker to build an image named `my-node-app` based on the instructions in your `Dockerfile`.

#### 3. Run the Docker Container

After building the image, start a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

- The `-p 3000:3000` flag maps port 3000 on your local machine to port 3000 inside the container.
- Now, go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see **"Hello, World!"** again, but this time it's being served from within a Docker container.

## üìà Summary Table

Here's a quick summary of the tools we installed and the steps we followed:

| **Tool**    | **Purpose**                                        | **Link**                                           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **VS Code** | Code editor for writing and debugging Node.js apps | [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) |
| **Node.js** | Runtime for executing JavaScript on the server     | [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)            |
| **Docker**  | Containerization platform to standardize the app   | [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/)         |
| **npm**     | Package manager for Node.js dependencies           | Bundled with Node.js                               |

### üö¢ What's Next?

You now have a Node.js application running both locally and in a Docker container! üéâ

Next, you could:

- Learn more about Docker volumes and networks to expand your application's capabilities.
- Use **Docker Compose** to manage multi-container applications (e.g., adding a database).
- Deploy your containerized application to a cloud platform such as **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure**.

Happy coding! üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
