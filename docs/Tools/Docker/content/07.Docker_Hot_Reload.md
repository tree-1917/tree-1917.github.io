## What is **Hot Reload**? 🔄

Hot Reload allows developers to see changes in their application in real-time without needing to restart the application or container. This can significantly speed up development and debugging processes, making it a game-changer for developers! 💡

### How to Show Logs for Any Container? 📜

You can view the logs of a running Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker logs <container_name_or_id>
```

- **Example**: To view logs for a container named `my_app`, you would run:

```bash
docker logs my_app
```

### How to Sync Between Local App Folder and App Folder in Container 📂

To enable hot reload, you'll want to sync your local application folder with the application folder inside the Docker container. Here’s a step-by-step tutorial using the `-v` option:

1. **Create a Dockerfile** 📄  
   Set up your Dockerfile to define your application environment.

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM node:14
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package.json ./
   RUN npm install
   COPY . ./
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image** 🏗️  
   Build the Docker image from your Dockerfile. In your terminal, run:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my_app .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container with Volume Sync** 🏃‍♂️  
   Use the `-v` option to mount your local application folder to the container.

   ```bash
   docker run -v $(pwd):/app -p 3000:3000 my_app
   ```

   This command does the following:

   - `-v $(pwd):/app` mounts the current directory (where your application code is) to the `/app` directory in the container. 🔗
   - `-p 3000:3000` maps port 3000 on your local machine to port 3000 in the container. 🌐

   🚀 Your local changes in the app folder will automatically reflect in the container without needing to rebuild it! 🎉

### Visual Representation 📊

#### Table: Comparison of Hot Reload vs. Traditional Reload

| Feature          | Hot Reload                      | Traditional Reload                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Speed            | Instant changes                 | Slower, requires a restart ⏳      |
| Development Flow | Smooth                          | Disrupted ⚠️                       |
| Use Case         | Ideal for active development 💻 | Suitable for production updates 🔒 |
