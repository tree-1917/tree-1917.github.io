## What is a Dockerfile? 📝

A **Dockerfile** is a text file that contains a series of instructions to build a Docker image for your project. It specifies the steps required to create an environment that can be used to run your application within a container. By using a Dockerfile, anyone can create a container from the image and run the project. 🌐

## Dockerfile **Vs** Docker Image **Vs** Docker Container ⚖️

| **Term**             | **Description**                                                                             | **Analogy**  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Dockerfile**       | A recipe that defines how to create an image.                                               | 🍽️ Recipe    |
| **Docker Image**     | A blueprint that describes the environment for running applications.                        | 🏗️ Blueprint |
| **Docker Container** | A running instance of an image, which contains everything needed to execute an application. | 📦 Container |

---

## How to Build an Image from a Dockerfile? 🏗️

To build an image from a Dockerfile, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> .
```

- `-t <image_name>:<tag>`: Specifies the name and tag of the image. 🏷️
- `.`: Indicates that the Dockerfile is in the current directory. 📂

---

## How to Build a Container from a Docker Image? 📦

To create a container from a Docker image, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name <container_name> <image_name>:<tag>
```

- `-d`: Run the container in detached mode (in the background). 🌌
- `--name <container_name>`: Assign a name to the container. 🏷️
- `<image_name>:<tag>`: Specifies the image from which to create the container. 🖼️

---

## What Does It Mean for a Container to Be Isolated? 🚧

A Docker container runs in an isolated environment. This means that the processes running inside the container are separated from the host system and other containers. Isolation provides:

- **Security**: Applications running in containers have limited access to the host system, reducing the risk of security breaches. 🔒
- **Resource Control**: Containers can be limited in terms of CPU and memory usage, ensuring that no single container can consume all available resources. ⚙️
- **Consistent Environments**: Each container can have its own dependencies and configurations, making it easier to manage and deploy applications across different environments. 📦

## How to Forward Ports from Local to Container? 🔄

To forward a port from your local machine to a Docker container, use the `-p` option when running the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p <host_port>:<container_port> --name <container_name> <image_name>:<tag>
```

- `-p <host_port>:<container_port>`: Maps the specified port on the host to the specified port in the container. 🌐

Example:

```bash
docker run -d -p 4002:4002 --name my_container my_image:latest
```
