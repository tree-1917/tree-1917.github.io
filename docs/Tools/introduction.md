## 📦 Docker

**Docker** is a platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications inside containers. Containers package an application along with its dependencies, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments.

### Key Features

- **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own isolated environment.
- **Portability**: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker.
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host system’s OS kernel, making them lightweight and fast.

### Getting Started

1. **Installation**: To install Docker on your system, use the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```
2. **Basic Commands**:
   - Verify Docker installation:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```
   - Run a sample container:
     ```bash
     docker run hello-world
     ```

## ☸️ Kubernetes

**Kubernetes** (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It allows you to manage clusters of containers with ease.

### Key Features

- **Automated Scaling**: Automatically adjust the number of running containers based on load.
- **Service Discovery**: Automatically expose services and manage load balancing.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically replace or reschedule containers that fail.

### Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Set up a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube, which is a tool to create a local Kubernetes cluster. Install Minikube with:
   ```bash
   curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
   sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
   ```
2. **Basic Commands**:
   - Start Minikube:
     ```bash
     minikube start
     ```
   - Check the status of the Kubernetes cluster:
     ```bash
     kubectl cluster-info
     ```

## 📝 Conclusion

Docker and Kubernetes are essential tools in modern DevOps, enabling efficient container management and orchestration. By understanding and utilizing these tools, you can streamline your development workflows and manage applications with greater efficiency. Explore the respective documentation for more in-depth tutorials and advanced features.
