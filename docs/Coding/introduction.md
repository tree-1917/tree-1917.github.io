# Overview of Algorithms and Data Structures 🚀

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science. They help us solve problems efficiently and manage data effectively. Let's explore these concepts using emojis! 🌟

## 📚 Algorithms

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a task. Think of it as a recipe in a cookbook. Here are some common types of algorithms:

### Sorting Algorithms 📈

Sorting algorithms arrange data in a particular order. Examples include:

- **Bubble Sort** 🧼
- **Quick Sort** ⚡
- **Merge Sort** 🔗

### Searching Algorithms 🔍

Searching algorithms help you find specific data within a collection. Examples include:

- **Binary Search** 🔢
- **Linear Search** 🔄

## 🗂️ Data Structures

A **data structure** is a way to store and organize data for efficient access and modification. Here are some common data structures:

### Arrays 📊

An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

### Linked Lists 🔗

A linked list is a linear collection of nodes, where each node points to the next one.

### Stacks 📚

A stack follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Think of it as a stack of plates where you add or remove plates from the top.

### Queues 🕰️

A queue follows First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Imagine a line at a checkout where the first person in line is the first to be served.

### Trees 🌳

Trees are hierarchical structures where each node has a value and a list of references to other nodes (its children).

### Graphs 📈

Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. They can represent networks, such as social connections or paths in a map.

## 🔄 Complexity Analysis

Understanding the **time** and **space complexity** of algorithms helps us choose the most efficient one for our needs.
