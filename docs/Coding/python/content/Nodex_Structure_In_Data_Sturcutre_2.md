# 📦 Understanding Nodes in Data Structures

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of many data structures, serving as units that hold data and establish connections to other nodes. This tutorial will guide you through the basic and advanced components of nodes, explaining their role and how they are used in various data structures.

## 🔍 What is a Node?

A **node** is a basic element of data structures that typically contains:

1. **Value/Data**: The actual information stored in the node.
2. **Pointer(s)/Reference(s)**: Links to other nodes that form the structure.

### 🧩 Importance of Nodes:

- **Dynamic Structures**: Nodes enable the creation of dynamic, flexible data structures.
- **Efficient Operations**: Nodes facilitate efficient insertion and deletion operations.
- **Foundation for Complex Structures**: Nodes are essential for constructing linked lists, trees, graphs, and more.

## 🛠️ Basic Node Components

### 1. **Value/Data**

- **Description**: The core content or information of the node.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  class Node:
      def __init__(self, data):
          self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
  ```

### 2. **Pointer(s)/Reference(s)**

- **Description**: Links to other nodes, defining the structure.

  **Example (Singly Linked List)**:

  ```python
  class Node:
      def __init__(self, data):
          self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
          self.next = None  # 👉 Pointer to the next node
  ```

---

## 🔗 Advanced Node Components

### 1. **Metadata**

Metadata provides additional information about the node.

#### **Examples**:

- **Priority**: In a priority queue, nodes might have a priority value.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  class PriorityQueueNode:
      def __init__(self, data, priority):
          self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
          self.priority = priority  # ⏫ Priority of the node
          self.next = None  # 👉 Pointer to the next node
  ```

- **Count or Size**: In balanced trees, nodes may track subtree sizes.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  class TreeNode:
      def __init__(self, data):
          self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
          self.left = None  # 👈 Pointer to the left child
          self.right = None  # 👉 Pointer to the right child
          self.size = 1  # 📏 Size of the subtree rooted at this node
  ```

### 2. **Flags or State Information**

Flags or state information track the node’s status or properties.

#### **Examples**:

- **Visited**: Indicates whether a node has been visited in graph algorithms.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  class GraphNode:
      def __init__(self, data):
          self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
          self.adjacent = []  # 🌐 List of adjacent nodes
          self.visited = False  # 🚦 Flag indicating if the node has been visited
  ```

- **Color**: Used in algorithms like those for Red-Black Trees.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  class RBTreeNode:
      def __init__(self, data):
          self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
          self.left = None  # 👈 Pointer to the left child
          self.right = None  # 👉 Pointer to the right child
          self.color = 'red'  # 🎨 Color of the node (for Red-Black Trees)
  ```

### 3. **Additional Pointers**

Some nodes have extra pointers for more complex data structures.

#### **Examples**:

- **Parent Pointer**: Points to the parent node in trees.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  class BinaryTreeNode:
      def __init__(self, data):
          self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
          self.left = None  # 👈 Pointer to the left child
          self.right = None  # 👉 Pointer to the right child
          self.parent = None  # 👪 Pointer to the parent node
  ```

- **Sibling Pointer**: Points to sibling nodes in certain structures.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  class TreeNodeWithSiblings:
      def __init__(self, data):
          self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
          self.left = None  # 👈 Pointer to the left child
          self.right = None  # 👉 Pointer to the right child
          self.sibling = None  # 👯 Pointer to the sibling node
  ```

---

## 📊 Summary

Nodes are versatile components essential for many data structures. They commonly contain:

- **Basic**: Value and pointers.
- **Advanced**: Metadata, flags/state, and extra pointers.

Understanding these components is key to designing and implementing efficient data structures and algorithms.

Happy coding! 💻🚀
