# 🧠 Memory-Level Data Structures: Arrays and Linked Lists

Understanding data structures at the memory level is crucial because they form the foundation for many complex structures. At the most basic level, there are two key implementations:

- **Arrays**: Contiguous blocks of memory.
- **Linked Lists**: Non-contiguous nodes linked by pointers.

In this tutorial, we’ll explore these two structures with clear explanations, examples in Python, and their relationships to higher-level data structures like trees and stacks.

## 🔢 1. Arrays

### What is an Array?

An **array** is a sequence of elements stored in a contiguous block of memory. Each element can be directly accessed using its index, making arrays efficient for random access.

### 🚀 Key Features:

- **Fixed Size**: In low-level languages like C, arrays have a fixed size.
- **Indexing**: Direct access to any element using an index (`O(1)` time complexity).
- **Insertion/Deletion**: Requires shifting elements, leading to `O(n)` time complexity.

### 🧑‍💻 Example in Python:

```python
# Example of an array (list) in Python
array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Accessing elements by index
print(array[2])  # Output: 30

# Inserting an element at the beginning (requires shifting)
array.insert(0, 5)
print(array)  # Output: [5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Deleting an element (requires shifting)
array.remove(30)
print(array)  # Output: [5, 10, 20, 40, 50]
```

### ✍️ Summary of Arrays:

- **Strength**: Fast access with `O(1)` time for reading and writing using an index.
- **Limitation**: Insertion and deletion are costly (`O(n)`), as they require shifting elements.

## 🔗 2. Linked Lists

### What is a Linked List?

A **linked list** is a collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (pointer) to the next node. Unlike arrays, linked lists don’t require contiguous memory and can dynamically grow or shrink.

### 🚀 Key Features:

- **Dynamic Size**: Can expand or contract as needed.
- **Sequential Access**: Accessing elements requires traversal (`O(n)` time complexity).
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Can be done in `O(1)` time if the position is known.

### 🧑‍💻 Example in Python:

```python
# Example of a simple singly linked list in Python

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
        self.next = None  # 👉 Pointer to the next node

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None  # 🚩 Head node

    # Inserting a new node at the beginning
    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node

    # Printing the linked list
    def print_list(self):
        current_node = self.head
        while current_node:
            print(current_node.data, end=" -> ")
            current_node = current_node.next
        print("None")

# Creating a linked list and adding nodes
ll = LinkedList()
ll.insert_at_beginning(30)
ll.insert_at_beginning(20)
ll.insert_at_beginning(10)

ll.print_list()  # Output: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> None
```

### ✍️ Summary of Linked Lists:

- **Strength**: Efficient for insertions and deletions, especially at the beginning or end.
- **Limitation**: Slower access (`O(n)` time) since you need to traverse the list.

## 🌳 Relationships to Higher-Level Data Structures

### 1. **Stacks**

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It can be implemented using both arrays and linked lists.

- **Array-Based Stack**:

  - **Structure**: Uses a fixed-size array.
  - **Operations**: Push and pop operations are `O(1)` if the array is not full.

- **Linked List-Based Stack**:
  - **Structure**: Uses nodes where the top of the stack is the head of the linked list.
  - **Operations**: Push and pop operations are `O(1)`.

**Example of a Stack Using a Linked List**:

```python
class StackNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
        self.next = None  # 👉 Pointer to the next node

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.top = None  # 🚩 Top of the stack

    def push(self, data):
        new_node = StackNode(data)
        new_node.next = self.top
        self.top = new_node

    def pop(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("Pop from an empty stack")
        popped_data = self.top.data
        self.top = self.top.next
        return popped_data

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.top is None

    def peek(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("Peek from an empty stack")
        return self.top.data

# Creating and using a stack
stack = Stack()
stack.push(10)
stack.push(20)
stack.push(30)

print(stack.pop())  # Output: 30
print(stack.peek())  # Output: 20
```

### 2. **Trees**

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges. Trees are often implemented using nodes (linked lists), where each node contains data and references to child nodes.

- **Array-Based Tree**:

  - **Structure**: Often used to implement complete or binary trees.
  - **Operations**: Access and modifications can be done using array indices.

- **Linked List-Based Tree**:
  - **Structure**: Each node contains data and pointers to child nodes.
  - **Operations**: Traversal and modifications are done through pointers.

**Example of a Simple Binary Tree Using Linked List Nodes**:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value  # 📝 Node value
        self.left = None  # 👉 Left child
        self.right = None  # 👉 Right child

    def insert(self, value):
        if value < self.value:
            if self.left is None:
                self.left = TreeNode(value)
            else:
                self.left.insert(value)
        else:
            if self.right is None:
                self.right = TreeNode(value)
            else:
                self.right.insert(value)

    def inorder_traversal(self):
        if self.left:
            self.left.inorder_traversal()
        print(self.value, end=" ")
        if self.right:
            self.right.inorder_traversal()

# Creating a binary tree and inserting nodes
root = TreeNode(10)
root.insert(5)
root.insert(15)
root.insert(3)
root.insert(7)

root.inorder_traversal()  # Output: 3 5 7 10 15
```

### ✍️ Summary of Higher-Level Data Structures:

- **Stacks**: Can be efficiently implemented using both arrays and linked lists. Stacks are useful for managing data with LIFO order.
- **Trees**: Commonly implemented with linked lists. Trees are essential for hierarchical data and are the basis for more complex structures like heaps and balanced trees.

## 📊 Overall Summary

Understanding arrays and linked lists at the memory level provides insight into how complex data structures are built:

- **Arrays** offer efficient index-based access and are used in structures like heaps and tables.
- **Linked Lists** enable dynamic sizing and efficient insertions/deletions, forming the basis for stacks, queues, and trees.

These fundamental structures underpin higher-level abstractions and algorithms, making them essential knowledge for designing efficient software systems.
