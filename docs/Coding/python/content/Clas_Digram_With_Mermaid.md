## 🛠️ Introduction to Mermaid Syntax

Mermaid uses a markdown-inspired syntax to create diagrams. For class diagrams, you use the `classDiagram` keyword to start.

### Basic Structure

```mermaid
classDiagram
    % Define your classes here
    class ClassName {
        + attributeName: AttributeType
        - privateAttribute: AttributeType
        # protectedAttribute: AttributeType
        + methodName(param: Type): ReturnType
    }
    % Define relationships here
```

- **`classDiagram`**: Begins the class diagram definition.
- **`class ClassName`**: Defines a class.
- **`+`**: Public attribute or method.
- **`-`**: Private attribute or method.
- **`#`**: Protected attribute or method.

---

## 🏷️ Defining Classes

To define a class, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name.

### Example

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Customer {
        + customerId: Integer
        + name: String
    }
```

---

## 📜 Adding Attributes and Methods

Inside each class, define attributes and methods using visibility indicators (`+`, `-`, `#`).

### Example

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Customer {
        + customerId: Integer
        + name: String
        - email: String
        + placeOrder(orderId: Integer): void
    }
```

## 🔗 Creating Relationships

Mermaid supports several types of relationships. Below are examples of eight different types of relationships.

### 1. **Association**

Represents a simple connection between two classes.

```mermaid
Customer "1" -- "0..*" Order : places
```

### 2. **Aggregation**

Represents a "whole-part" relationship where the parts can exist independently of the whole.

```mermaid
Order "1" o-- "0..*" OrderItem : contains
```

### 3. **Composition**

A stronger form of aggregation where the parts cannot exist without the whole.

```mermaid
Order "1" *-- "0..*" OrderItem : consists of
```

### 4. **Inheritance (Generalization)**

Represents an "is-a" relationship where one class inherits from another.

```mermaid
Employee <|-- Manager : is a
```

### 5. **Realization (Interface Implementation)**

Indicates that a class implements an interface.

```mermaid
Customer ..|> ICustomerService : implements
```

### 6. **Dependency**

Represents a "uses" relationship where one class depends on another.

```mermaid
Order ..> Product : depends on
```

### 7. **Bidirectional Association**

A two-way association where both classes are aware of each other.

```mermaid
Customer "1" -- "0..*" Order : places
Order "0..*" -- "1" Customer : is placed by
```

### 8. **Unidirectional Association**

A one-way association where only one class is aware of and interacts with another.

```mermaid
Order "1" --> "1" Customer : is placed by
```

## 🖼️ Visualizing the Diagram

To visualize your Mermaid class diagram, use the following tools:

1. **Mermaid Live Editor**: Visit [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) to paste your Mermaid code and see the rendered diagram.
2. **Markdown Editors**: Many editors (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) support Mermaid diagrams natively.
3. **IDE Integration**: IDEs like VSCode have Mermaid extensions for in-editor visualization.

## 📚 Example Class Diagram

Here’s an example of a complete class diagram for a shop system using all eight relationships:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Customer {
        + customerId: Integer
        + name: String
        + email: String
        + placeOrder(orderId: Integer): void
    }

    class Order {
        + orderId: Integer
        + orderDate: Date
        + totalAmount: Decimal
        + status: String
        + calculateTotal(): Decimal
        + updateStatus(newStatus: String): void
    }

    class Product {
        + productId: Integer
        + name: String
        + price: Decimal
        + updateStock(quantity: Integer): void
    }

    class OrderItem {
        + itemId: Integer
        + quantity: Integer
        + price: Decimal
        + calculateItemTotal(): Decimal
    }

    class ICustomerService {
        + getCustomerById(customerId: Integer): Customer
    }

    Customer "1" -- "0..*" Order : places
    Order "1" o-- "0..*" OrderItem : contains
    Product "1" *-- "0..*" OrderItem : is included in
    OrderItem "1" -- "1" Product : details
    Order ..> Product : depends on
    Customer ..|> ICustomerService : implements
    Order "1" --> "1" Customer : is placed by
    Customer "1" -- "0..*" Order : places
    Order "0..*" -- "1" Customer : is placed by
```
