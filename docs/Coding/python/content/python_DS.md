### 1. Introduction 📝

Python offers a wide range of built-in and library-based data structures that make it easier to manage and organize data efficiently. In this tutorial, we'll explore the best methods to import these data structures and discuss the various operations that can be performed on them.

### 2. Importing Data Structures from Python Libraries 📚

Python's standard library provides various data structures. Here's how to import each of them:

#### List 📋

Lists are dynamic arrays that can hold elements of any data type.

```python
# No import needed; lists are built-in
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### Tuple 📦

Tuples are immutable sequences, meaning once created, their elements cannot be modified.

```python
# No import needed; tuples are built-in
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

#### Set 🔧

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.

```python
# No import needed; sets are built-in
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

#### Dictionary 📖

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.

```python
# No import needed; dictionaries are built-in
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

#### Queue 🚶‍♂️

Queues are FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structures. Python's `queue` module provides this functionality.

```python
import queue

my_queue = queue.Queue()
```

#### Deque 🛤️

Deques (Double-Ended Queues) allow adding and removing elements from both ends. They are more efficient than lists for these operations.

```python
from collections import deque

my_deque = deque([1, 2, 3])
```

#### Heap ⛰️

Heaps are complete binary trees where the parent node is always less than or equal to its children (min-heap). The `heapq` module provides an implementation.

```python
import heapq

my_heap = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
heapq.heapify(my_heap)
```

#### Tree 🌳

Python does not have a built-in tree data structure, but you can implement it using classes. Alternatively, you can use libraries like `anytree` or `binarytree`.

```python
from anytree import Node, RenderTree

root = Node("Root")
child1 = Node("Child1", parent=root)
child2 = Node("Child2", parent=root)
```

#### Graph 🌐

For graph data structures, you can use libraries like `networkx` or implement your own using dictionaries or adjacency lists.

```python
import networkx as nx

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_node(1)
G.add_edge(1, 2)
```

### 3. Operations on Each Data Structure 🔨

Now that we know how to import these data structures, let's look at the basic operations we can perform on each one.

#### List Operations 📋

- **Add Elements:**
  ```python
  my_list.append(6)
  my_list.insert(0, 0)  # Insert at specific position
  ```
- **Remove Elements:**
  ```python
  my_list.remove(3)  # Remove by value
  my_list.pop()      # Remove the last element
  ```
- **Access Elements:**
  ```python
  element = my_list[2]  # Access by index
  ```
- **Slice Elements:**
  ```python
  sub_list = my_list[1:3]  # Slice a portion of the list
  ```

#### Tuple Operations 📦

- **Access Elements:**
  ```python
  element = my_tuple[1]
  ```
- **Slice Elements:**
  ```python
  sub_tuple = my_tuple[1:3]
  ```
- **Concatenate Tuples:**
  ```python
  new_tuple = my_tuple + (6, 7)
  ```

#### Set Operations 🔧

- **Add Elements:**
  ```python
  my_set.add(6)
  ```
- **Remove Elements:**
  ```python
  my_set.remove(3)  # Raises KeyError if element is not found
  my_set.discard(7) # Does nothing if element is not found
  ```
- **Union and Intersection:**
  ```python
  another_set = {4, 5, 6, 7}
  union_set = my_set.union(another_set)
  intersection_set = my_set.intersection(another_set)
  ```

#### Dictionary Operations 📖

- **Add/Update Elements:**
  ```python
  my_dict['d'] = 4
  ```
- **Remove Elements:**
  ```python
  del my_dict['a']
  ```
- **Access Elements:**
  ```python
  value = my_dict['b']
  ```
- **Iterate Over Elements:**
  ```python
  for key, value in my_dict.items():
      print(key, value)
  ```

#### Queue Operations 🚶‍♂️

- **Enqueue (Add Elements):**
  ```python
  my_queue.put(1)
  my_queue.put(2)
  ```
- **Dequeue (Remove Elements):**
  ```python
  element = my_queue.get()
  ```
- **Check Full/Empty:**
  ```python
  is_full = my_queue.full()
  is_empty = my_queue.empty()
  ```

#### Deque Operations 🛤️

- **Add Elements to Both Ends:**
  ```python
  my_deque.append(4)     # Add to the right end
  my_deque.appendleft(0) # Add to the left end
  ```
- **Remove Elements from Both Ends:**
  ```python
  my_deque.pop()          # Remove from the right end
  my_deque.popleft()      # Remove from the left end
  ```
- **Access Elements:**
  ```python
  rightmost = my_deque[-1]
  leftmost = my_deque[0]
  ```

#### Heap Operations ⛰️

- **Push Elements:**
  ```python
  heapq.heappush(my_heap, 2)
  ```
- **Pop Elements:**
  ```python
  smallest = heapq.heappop(my_heap)
  ```
- **Peek at Smallest Element:**
  ```python
  smallest = my_heap[0]
  ```

#### Tree Operations 🌳

- **Add Nodes:**
  ```python
  child3 = Node("Child3", parent=child1)
  ```
- **Display Tree Structure:**
  ```python
  for pre, fill, node in RenderTree(root):
      print(f"{pre}{node.name}")
  ```

#### Graph Operations 🌐

- **Add Nodes and Edges:**
  ```python
  G.add_node(3)
  G.add_edge(2, 3)
  ```
- **Check for Nodes and Edges:**
  ```python
  has_node = G.has_node(3)
  has_edge = G.has_edge(2, 3)
  ```
- **Find Shortest Path:**
  ```python
  path = nx.shortest_path(G, source=1, target=3)
  ```

### 4. Conclusion 🎯

Understanding how to import and use different data structures in Python is crucial for efficient coding. Each data structure has its unique set of operations and is suited for specific tasks. By mastering these, you can write more efficient and effective Python programs.

Happy Coding! 🐍
