# 📦 Node Structures in Real Data Structures

Nodes are fundamental building blocks in many data structures. The number of pointers a node contains depends on the data structure's requirements. Here’s an overview of common node types and their pointer configurations:

## 🔗 1. **Single Pointer Node**

### **Used In**:

- **Singly Linked Lists (SLL)**

### **Description**:

Each node has one pointer that references the next node in the sequence.

### **Diagram**:

```
[Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> None
```

### **Example**:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
        self.next = None  # 👉 Pointer to the next node
```

### **Use Cases**:

- Efficient for simple, linear data traversal.
- Suitable for basic linked lists and stack implementations.

## 🔗 2. **Double Pointer Node**

### **Used In**:

- **Doubly Linked Lists (DLL)**

### **Description**:

Each node has two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node.

### **Diagram**:

```
None <- [Prev | Data | Next] <-> [Prev | Data | Next] <-> [Prev | Data | Next] -> None
```

### **Example**:

```python
class DoublyNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
        self.next = None  # 👉 Pointer to the next node
        self.prev = None  # 👈 Pointer to the previous node
```

### **Use Cases**:

- Allows bidirectional traversal.
- Useful for implementing complex data structures like certain types of queues and deques.

## 🔗 3. **Triple Pointer Node**

### **Used In**:

- **Ternary Trees**: Where each node has up to three child pointers.
- **Specialized Data Structures**: Such as certain graph representations.

### **Description**:

Each node has three pointers, for example, to the left, middle, and right children in a ternary tree.

### **Diagram**:

```
     [Data | Left | Middle | Right]
     /         |           |          \
  [Data]    [Data]     [Data]     [Data]
```

### **Example** (for a ternary tree):

```python
class TernaryNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
        self.left = None  # 👈 Pointer to the left child
        self.middle = None  # 👉 Pointer to the middle child
        self.right = None  # 👉 Pointer to the right child
```

### **Use Cases**:

- Suitable for ternary trees where nodes have three children.
- Useful in certain types of game trees or decision trees.

## 🔗 4. **More Than Three Pointers**

### **Rarely Used**:

While nodes with more than three pointers are less common, they can be used in specialized data structures or applications. For instance:

- **Quadtrees**: Nodes have four pointers for partitioning space into four quadrants.
- **Graphs**: Nodes may have a varying number of pointers based on the graph's connectivity, but these are usually handled by adjacency lists or matrices rather than having a fixed number of pointers in each node.

### **Example (Quadtree Node)**:

```python
class QuadtreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # 📝 Node data
        self.nw = None  # 🌐 Pointer to the northwest quadrant
        self.ne = None  # 🌐 Pointer to the northeast quadrant
        self.sw = None  # 🌐 Pointer to the southwest quadrant
        self.se = None  # 🌐 Pointer to the southeast quadrant
```

### **Use Cases**:

- Used in spatial partitioning for graphics, geographical data, and collision detection.

## 📊 Summary

Nodes are versatile components in data structures and their configuration depends on the needs of the structure:

- **Single Pointer**: Common in singly linked lists.
- **Double Pointer**: Used in doubly linked lists.
- **Triple Pointer**: Seen in ternary trees and specialized structures.
- **More Pointers**: Used in complex data structures like quadtrees or for advanced graph representations.

Understanding these variations helps in selecting the appropriate data structure for a given problem and implementing efficient algorithms.

Happy coding! 💻🚀
