# 🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## 📚 Tutorial Outline

1. **Introduction to OOP**
2. **Understanding Methods**
3. **Understanding Instantiation**
4. **How to Create a Class in Python**
5. **Advanced Examples**

### 1. 🤔 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (attributes) and functions (methods). Key principles of OOP include:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit (class).
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: Using a common interface for different data types.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features.

OOP helps in creating reusable and modular code, which is crucial for building complex software systems, like data structures.

### 2. 🛠️ What is a Method?

A **method** is a function that is defined inside a class. Methods allow objects to perform actions and interact with their attributes. They are called using the object and often describe the behavior of that object.

**Example:**

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # 🐕 Attribute: The dog's name

    def bark(self):
        return f"🐶 {self.name} is barking!"

# Creating a Dog object and calling the method
my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: 🐶 Buddy is barking!
```

- **Explanation:** In this example, `bark()` is a method that defines a behavior for the `Dog` class. Methods are used to perform actions and operate on an object’s data.

### 3. 🔨 What is Instantiation?

**Instantiation** is the process of creating an instance (object) from a class. When you instantiate a class, you create a specific object that has its own attributes and methods.

**Example:**

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand  # 🚗 Attribute: Car brand
        self.model = model  # 🚙 Attribute: Car model

# Instantiating (creating) objects from the Car class
my_car = Car("Tesla", "Model S")
your_car = Car("Ford", "Mustang")

# Each object is unique with its own data
print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Tesla
print(your_car.model)  # Output: Mustang
```

- **Explanation:** `my_car` and `your_car` are instances (objects) of the `Car` class. This is called **instantiation**, where each object has its own attributes and methods.

---

### 4. 🏛️ How to Create a Class in Python

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that objects created from the class will have.

**Steps to Create a Class:**

1. Use the `class` keyword followed by the class name.
2. Define the `__init__` method (constructor) to initialize object attributes.
3. Add any other methods you want the class to have.

**Example:**

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title  # 📚 Attribute: Book title
        self.author = author  # 🖋️ Attribute: Book author

    def describe(self):
        return f"📖 '{self.title}' by {self.author}"

# Creating an object from the Book class
my_book = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
print(my_book.describe())  # Output: 📖 '1984' by George Orwell
```

- **Explanation:** This class defines a `Book` with attributes `title` and `author` and a method `describe()` to return a description of the book.

### 5. 🧰 Advanced Examples of Classes

Let’s dive deeper into some examples to see how classes and methods work together.

---

#### Example 1: 🍪 Cookie Factory

```python
class Cookie:
    def __init__(self, flavor, size):
        self.flavor = flavor  # 🎨 Attribute: Flavor of the cookie
        self.size = size      # 📏 Attribute: Size of the cookie
        print("🍪 A delicious cookie is baked!")

    def describe(self):
        return f"🍪 This is a {self.size} {self.flavor} cookie."

# Creating a Cookie object
chocolate_chip = Cookie("chocolate chip", "large")
print(chocolate_chip.describe())  # Output: 🍪 This is a large chocolate chip cookie.
```

- **Explanation:** This example demonstrates how a class can be used to create objects (cookies) with specific attributes (flavor and size) and behaviors (describe the cookie).

#### Example 2: 🏠 House Blueprint

```python
class House:
    def __init__(self, bedrooms, bathrooms, color):
        self.bedrooms = bedrooms  # 🛏️ Attribute: Number of bedrooms
        self.bathrooms = bathrooms  # 🚿 Attribute: Number of bathrooms
        self.color = color  # 🎨 Attribute: Color of the house

    def describe(self):
        return f"🏠 A {self.color} house with {self.bedrooms} bedrooms and {self.bathrooms} bathrooms."

    def paint_house(self, new_color):
        self.color = new_color  # 🎨 Change the color of the house
        print(f"🎨 The house is now {self.color}!")

# Creating a House object
my_house = House(3, 2, "blue")
print(my_house.describe())  # Output: 🏠 A blue house with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.
my_house.paint_house("green")  # Output: 🎨 The house is now green!
```

- **Explanation:** This example shows how classes can have multiple attributes and methods that modify those attributes.

---

#### Example 3: 🚀 Spaceship Control

```python
class Spaceship:
    def __init__(self, name, speed):
        self.name = name  # 🚀 Attribute: Name of the spaceship
        self.speed = speed  # 🌀 Attribute: Speed of the spaceship

    def launch(self):
        return f"🚀 The spaceship {self.name} is launching at {self.speed} speed!"

    def accelerate(self, increase):
        self.speed += increase  # 🏎️ Increase the spaceship speed
        print(f"⚡ The speed is now {self.speed}!")

# Creating a Spaceship object
falcon = Spaceship("Falcon", 1000)
print(falcon.launch())  # Output: 🚀 The spaceship Falcon is launching at 1000 speed.
falcon.accelerate(500)  # Output: ⚡ The speed is now 1500!
```

- **Explanation:** This example illustrates a class with methods that modify its attributes, demonstrating how objects can change behavior dynamically.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- A **method** is a function inside a class that defines an object’s behavior.
- **Instantiation** is the process of creating an object from a class.
- A **class** is a blueprint for objects, defining attributes and methods.
- OOP makes code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
