# Introduction to Python and Shell Projects üêçüîß

Welcome to the projects section! In this guide, we will dive into a practical project that combines the power of Python with the flexibility of Shell scripting. This project will help you gain hands-on experience with both technologies and understand how they can complement each other in real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview

Our project aims to create a **data processing pipeline** using Python and Shell scripting. The pipeline will automate the process of data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) from various sources into a consolidated report.

### Project Goals üéØ

- **Data Extraction**: Use Shell scripts to automate the extraction of data from multiple sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Employ Python to process and transform the data into a desired format.
- **Data Loading**: Save the transformed data into a structured report or database.
- **Automation**: Integrate the Shell and Python scripts to run the entire pipeline automatically.

## Project Components

### 1. Shell Scripting üåê

Shell scripting will be used for:

- **Automating Data Extraction**: Writing scripts to download or fetch data files from remote servers or APIs.
- **File Management**: Organizing and preparing data files for processing.

### 2. Python Scripting üêç

Python will be utilized for:

- **Data Processing**: Reading, cleaning, and transforming data using libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy`.
- **Generating Reports**: Creating reports or visualizations from the processed data.

### 3. Integration ü§ù

The Shell and Python scripts will be integrated using:

- **Shell Commands**: To call Python scripts and handle input/output between scripts.
- **Cron Jobs**: For scheduling the pipeline to run automatically at specified intervals.

## Getting Started üöÄ

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to getting started with the project:

### Step 1: Setup Your Environment

- **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Install Shell Tools**: Ensure you have access to Shell or Terminal on your system. For Windows, you might use Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

### Step 2: Create Your Shell Scripts

1. **Data Extraction Script**: Write Shell scripts to fetch data from sources.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   wget http://example.com/data.csv -O data.csv
   ```

2. **File Management Script**: Organize files as needed.
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   mv data.csv /path/to/working/directory/
   ```

### Step 3: Develop Your Python Scripts

1. **Data Transformation Script**: Use Python to process the data.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load data
   df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

   # Transform data
   df['new_column'] = df['existing_column'].apply(lambda x: x * 2)

   # Save transformed data
   df.to_csv('transformed_data.csv', index=False)
   ```

2. **Report Generation Script**: Generate reports or visualizations.

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Load transformed data
   df = pd.read_csv('transformed_data.csv')

   # Create a plot
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   plt.plot(df['new_column'])
   plt.title('Transformed Data')
   plt.savefig('report.png')
   ```

### Step 4: Integrate and Automate

- **Create a Master Script**: Use Shell to call Python scripts in sequence.

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  ./data_extraction.sh
  python3 data_transformation.py
  python3 report_generation.py
  ```

- **Set Up Cron Jobs**: Schedule the master script to run periodically.
  ```bash
  crontab -e
  ```
  Add the following line to run the script daily at midnight:
  ```bash
  0 0 * * * /path/to/master_script.sh
  ```

## Resources and Tools üõ†Ô∏è

- **Python Documentation**: [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- **Shell Scripting Guide**: [Shell Scripting Tutorial](https://www.shellscript.sh)
- **Cron Jobs**: [Cron How-To](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto)

## Next Steps

Now that you have an overview, start by setting up your environment and creating the necessary scripts. As you progress, you'll gain valuable experience in both Python and Shell scripting, and you'll see how they can be combined to create powerful automation solutions.

Happy coding and scripting! üöÄüíª
